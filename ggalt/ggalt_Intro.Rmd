https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggalt/vignettes/ggalt_examples.html

* A compendium of new geometries, coordinate systems, statistical transformations, scales and fonts for 'ggplot2', including 
splines, 1d and 2d densities, univariate average shifted histograms, a new map coordinate system based on the 'PROJ.4'-library 
along with ``geom_cartogram()`` that mimics the original functionality of ``geom_map()``, formatters for "bytes", a ``stat_stepribbon()`` 
function, increased 'plotly' compatibility and the 'StateFace' open source font 'ProPublica'. 


* Further new functionality includes lollipop charts, dumbbell charts, the ability to encircle points and coordinate-system-based text annotations.
