### Links
Links are the ggforce equivalent of segments, i.e. connecting two points by a straight line. 
While ``geom_segment()`` does a decent job of this, the link geoms expand the straight line into the base, 0, and 2 versions making it possible to interpolate aesthetics and add gradients to the segment. The 0 version is just a renamed geom_segment included for completeness.

```{r}
links <- data.frame(
    x = 0, y = 0, xend = runif(10), yend = runif(10)
)
ggplot() + geom_link(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend, 
                         alpha = ..index..), data = links)

```


```{r}
# The 2 version also allows for drawing paths
links2 <- data.frame(
    x = runif(10), y = runif(10), group = rep(c(1,2), each = 5), 
    colour = sample(5, 10, TRUE)
)
ggplot() + geom_link2(aes(x = x, y = y, group = group, colour = factor(colour)), 
                      data = links2)
```
