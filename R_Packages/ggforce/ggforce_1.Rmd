#### Introduction
This document serves as the main overview of the ggforce package, and will try to explain the hows and whys of the different extension along with clear visual examples. It will try to link back to relevant academic articles describing the different visualization types in more detail - both for the benefit of the reader but also to give credit to the people who thought long and hard about how to best present your data.
#### Geom versions
Some of the geom versions presented below, comes in two or more flavors, potentially suffixed with 0 or 2, such as for geom_bezier which also comes in the versions geom_bezier0 and geom_bezier2. This pattern is mainly used in line drawings such as splines, arcs and bezier and has been adopted for edge drawing in the ggraph package as well. In all cases the base version (no suffix) has been implemented efficiently in C++ and produces a set of points along the line, that can be traced using a path. The benefit of this is that the detail level can be chosen, thus giving the user control over the rendering time. On top of that, an additional column is added to the data with the position along the path, which can be used to map e.g. an opacity gradient to. For the base version each line is encoded in one row using x, y, xend, and yend in the same manner as known as geom_segment. The same input format is used for the 0-version, but this version maps directly to native grid grobs. While there is seldom a performance reason to use the native grobs, these version do ensure that the path is always smooth (For the base versions this is dependent on the number of points calculated). The 0-versions does not allow for mapping of gradients to the path. The 2-version changes the input format into encoding the start and end points on different rows in the same manner as for geom_path. The benefit of this is that different aesthetic variables can be defined for the start and end, e.g. colour, and these versions will make sure to interpolate that aesthetic along the path so you can get e.g. smooth transition of size, colour, and opacity along a spline.
#### Layers
This section shows the extensions to ggplot2â€™s geoms and stats. It rarely makes sense to talk about one and not the other, so they are grouped together here. Often the focus will be on the geoms, unless a new stat does not have an accompanying geom, in which case the stat will be discussed along with which geoms it should be used with.
