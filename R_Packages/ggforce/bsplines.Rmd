B-splines
Like beziers b-splines are smooth curves, but unlike beziers b-splines are defined by a vector of control points along which the curve will flow, without necessarily passing through any of the control points. The 0-version is impemented using xsplineGrob with shape = 1, which approximates a b-spline, but a slight variation is expected due to this.
spline <- data.frame(
    x = runif(5), y = runif(5), group = 1
)
ggplot(spline) + geom_path(aes(x = x, y = y, group = group), colour = 'grey') + 
    geom_bspline(aes(x = x, y = y, group = group)) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y))
