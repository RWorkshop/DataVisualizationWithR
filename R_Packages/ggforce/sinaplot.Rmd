### SinaPlot
geom_sina is inspired by the strip chart and the violin plot and operates by letting the normalized density of points restrict the jitter along the x-axis. The representation of the data as a whole remains simple, the density distribution is apparent, and the plot still provides information on how many data points are present in each class and whether outliers are driving the tails of the distribution. In this way it is possible to convey information about the mean/median of the data, its variance and the actual number of data points together with a density distribution.

```{r}
###Sample gaussian distributions with 1, 2 and 3 modes.
df <- data.frame(
  "Distribution" = c(rep("Unimodal", 500),
                     rep("Bimodal", 250),
                     rep("Trimodal", 600)),
  "Value" = c(rnorm(500, 6, 1),
              rnorm(200, 3, .7), rnorm(50, 7, 0.4),
              rnorm(200, 2, 0.7), rnorm(300, 5.5, 0.4), rnorm(100, 8, 0.4))
)

# Reorder levels
df$Distribution <- factor(df$Distribution,
                          levels(df$Distribution)[c(3, 1, 2)])

p <- ggplot(df, aes(Distribution, Value))
p + geom_violin(aes(fill = Distribution))

p + geom_sina(aes(color = Distribution), size = 1)
