Select and slice a tibble nested in data

### Description
stat_partial_tb selects columns and/or remanes them and/or slices rows from a tible nested in data. This stat is designed to be used to pre-process tibble objects mapped to the label aesthetic before adding them to a plot with geom_table.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>
stat_fmt_tb(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, geom = "table", tb.vars = NULL, tb.rows = NULL, digits = 3, position = "identity", na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE, inherit.aes = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>
### Arguments

* ``mapping``: The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with aes or aes_. Only needs to be
set at the layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.
* ``data ``: A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override the plot defaults.
* geom The geometric object to use display the data
* tb.vars character vector, optionally named, used to select and or rename the columns of the table returned.
* tb.rows integer vector of row indexes of rows to be retained.
* digits integer indicating the number of significant digits to be retained in data.
* ``position``: The position adjustment to use for overlapping points on this layer
* ``na.rm``: a logical indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.
* ``show.legend ``: logical. Should this layer be included in the legends? NA, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. FALSE never includes, and TRUE always includes.
* inherit.aes If FALSE, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions that define both data and aesthetics and shouldnâ€™t inherit behaviour from the default plot specification, e.g. borders.
* ``...``:   Other arguments passed on to layer. This can include aesthetics whose values
you want to set, not map. See layer for more details..


### Examples 
```{r} 
library(ggplot2)
my.df <- tibble::tibble(x = c(1, 2),
y = c(0, 4),
group = c("A", "B"),
tbs = list(a = tibble::tibble(X = 1:6, Y = rep(c("x", "y"), 3)),
b = tibble::tibble(X = 1:3, Y = "x")))
ggplot(my.df, aes(x, y, label = tbs)) +
stat_fmt_tb() +
expand_limits(x = c(0,3), y = c(-2, 6))
ggplot(my.df, aes(x, y, label = tbs)) +
stat_fmt_tb(tb.vars = c(value = "X", group = "Y"),
tb.rows = 1:3) +
expand_limits(x = c(0,3), y = c(-2, 6))
```

####Computed variables

The output of sequentially applying slice with tb.rows as argument and select with tb.vars to
a list variable list mapped to label and containing a single tibble per row in data.
