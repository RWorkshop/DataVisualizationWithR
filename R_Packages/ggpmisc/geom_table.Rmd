## ``geom_table`` Tables
### Description
geom_table adds a textual table directly to the ggplot using syntax similar to that of ``geom_label``.

#### Usage 
 <pre><code>
geom_table(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", ..., parse = FALSE, check_overlap = FALSE,
  na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE)
</code></pre>

### Arguments

* ``mapping``: The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with aes or aes_. Only needs to be
set at the layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.
* ``data ``: A layer specific dataset - only needed if you want to override the plot defaults.
* ``stat ``: The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer, as a string.
position Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of a call to a position adjustment
function.
... other arguments passed on to layer. This can include aesthetics whose values
you want to set, not map. See layer for more details..
parse If TRUE, the labels will be parsed into expressions and displayed as described
in ?plotmath.
* ``check_overlap``: If TRUE, text that overlaps previous text in the same layer will not be plotted.
na.rm If FALSE (the default), removes missing values with a warning. If TRUE silently
removes missing values.
* ``show.legend ``: logical. Should this layer be included in the legends? NA, the default, includes if
any aesthetics are mapped. FALSE never includes, and TRUE always includes.
* ``inherit.aes``: If FALSE, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than combining with them.
This is most useful for helper functions that define both data and aesthetics and
shouldnâ€™t inherit behaviour from the default plot specification, e.g. borders.

#### Details
Note the "width" and "height" like of a text element are 0, so stacking and dodging tables will not
work by default, and axis limits are not automatically expanded to include all tables. Obviously,
tables do have height and width, but they are physical units, not data units. The amount of space
they occupy on that plot is not constant in data units: when you resize a plot, tables stay the same
size, but the size of the axes changes.

#### Alignment
You can modify table alignment with the vjust and hjust aesthetics. These can either be a number
between 0 (right/bottom) and 1 (top/left) or a character ("left", "middle", "right", "bottom", "center",
"top").


#### Note
This geom works only with tibbles as data, as it expects a list of data frames or a list of tibbles
to be mapped to the label aesthetic. In the current version the following aesthetics affect the text
within the table size, colour, and alpha. The argument to parameter parse is simply passed
forward to gridExtra::ttheme_default(). As x and y determine the position of the whole table,
similarly to that of a text label, justification is interpreted as indicating the position of the table with
respect to the $x$ and $y$ coordinates in the data, and angle is used to rotate the table as a whole.
Other aesthetics, including fill are not yet implemented, neither are themes for table formatting.
annotate() cannot be used with geom = "table". Use geom_table directly also for adding annotations.
