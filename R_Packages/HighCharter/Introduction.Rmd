Highcharter is an R wrapper for Highcharts, an interactive visualization library in JavaScript. Like its predecessor, highcharter features a powerful API.

Highcharter makes dynamic charting easy. It uses a single function, hchart(), to draw plots for all kinds of R object classes, from data frame to dendrogram to phylo. It also gives R coders a handy way to access the other popular Highcharts plot types, Highstock (for financial charting) and Highmaps (for schematic maps in web-based projects).

The package has easy-to-customize themes, along with built-in themes like “economist,” “financial times,” and “538,” in case you want to borrow a look for your chart from the pros.
